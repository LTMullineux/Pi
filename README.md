# Pi
Estimating [pi](https://ltmullineux.github.io/Pi/.) with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and Monte Carlo sampling.

- Points are randomly sampled from inside a square with side length `2r`.
- The total number of points `= N_total`.
- Points that fall inside the circle with radius `= r` that lies inside the square are tallied `= N_inside`.
- Pi is then estimated as `pi = `.
